Go MySQL Replay
===============

**This fork of the [original](https://github.com/dveeden/go-mysql-replay) contains a critical fix to support true parallel sessions and better connection handling.**

Replays statements from a traffic dump or captures from Performance Schema.

WARNING: This tool will execute operations that can change your data if those
 operations are in your dump file. Don't run it against your production DB!

Requirements
============

* MySQL
* go (if building from source, best with 1.5)
* tshark (optional, to capturing and convert network traffic)
* tcpdump (optional, to capture network traffic)
* Access to the network interface to capture.
* Access to `performance_schema`. (if capturing from PS)

Note that wireshark/tshark should be able to decode SSL/TLS if you give it
 your key and configure MySQL to not use Diffie-Hellman.

Building
========

This should build a static binary with Go 1.5
```
$ go build -tags netgo
```

Workflow
========

1. Capture data

```
# tcpdump -i eth0 -w mysql.pcap -s0 -G 60 -W 1 'dst port 3306'
```

-i interface
-w write to file
-s snaplen
-G seconds to run
-W number of times to run

2. Convert your data to a tab dilimtered file with tshark

```
$ tshark -r mysql.pcap -Y mysql.query -Y mysql.command -e tcp.stream \
> -e frame.time_epoch -e mysql.command -e mysql.query \
> -Tfields -E quote=d > my_workload.dat
```

3. Replay the statements

```
$ ./go-mysql-replay -f my_workload.dat
```

To combine steps 1 and 2:

    $ sudo tshark -i lo -Y mysql.query -Y mysql.command -e tcp.stream \
    > -e frame.time_epoch -e mysql.command -e mysql.query \
    > -Tfields -E quote=d
    Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
    Capturing on 'Loopback'

    "0"	"1445166898.745338000" 	"3" "SELECT VERSION()"
    "0"	"1445166898.745516000" 	"3" "SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    "1"	"1445166923.496890000" 	"3" "select @@version_comment limit 1"
    "1"	"1445166923.497021000" 	"3" "SELECT VERSION()"
    "1"	"1445166923.497140000" 	"3" "SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    ^C1 packet dropped
    6 packets captured

If MySQL runs on a non-standard port you might want to add: `-d tcp.port==5709,mysql` to tshark to tell it to decode
port 5709 as mysql.


Using Performance Schema
========================

Note: this has not been tested/updated after v0.1 yet. So this is missing the command column.

You need to enable the consumer for one or more events statements tables. You
might want to adjust `performance_schema_events_statements_history_long_size`
to control how many statements you're capturing

    UPDATE setup_consumers SET ENABLED='YES' WHERE NAME='events_statements_history_long';

The to capture the statements:

    SELECT THREAD_ID, TIMER_START*10e-13, SQL_TEXT FROM events_statements_history_long
    WHERE SQL_TEXT IS NOT NULL INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/statements_from_ps.dat';

TODO
====

* Better handle the default database of each connection (hardcoded now).
* `-E quote=d` does not escape quotes: [Wireshark Bug #10284](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10284)
